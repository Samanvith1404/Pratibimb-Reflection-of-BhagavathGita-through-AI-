# Talk to Sri Krishna

Talk to Krishna is a narrative-based AI system that frames human dilemmas using the Bhagavad Gita as contextual grounding — without advice, prescriptions, or religious authority.

The system listens to long personal stories, extracts causal conflicts, maps them to the Krishna–Arjuna dialogue, and presents a neutral reflective frame.

## Core Principles

- No advice or prescriptions  
- No divine impersonation  
- No moral instruction  
- No emotional manipulation  
- Human agency is always preserved

## Architecture

User Story  
→ Chunking LLM (causal problem extraction)  
→ Vector Database (Bhagavad Gita)  
→ LLM-1 (Krishna–Arjuna conversation + user mapping)  
→ LLM-2 (decision framing)  
→ LLM-3 (final structured neutral output with sloka references)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

print(output)
```

## Design Philosophy

This system is intentionally non-directive.  
It does not tell the user what to do.  
It does not interpret religious truth.  

It only reframes the situation using classical context.
